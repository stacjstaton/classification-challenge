# classification-challenge
##  Improving the email filtering system for its customers. 
I have a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. I will to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.
There will be created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The two models will be logistic regression model and a random forest model.
